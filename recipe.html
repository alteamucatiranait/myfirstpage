<h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it’s always a big hit at 
parties. My father recommends:<p>
<p><em>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just 
bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try 
serving it warm."</em></p>

<ul>
Ingredients:
<li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
<li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
<li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
<li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth 
as possible.<br>
Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are 
incorporated, but still retain some
texture.<br>
Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish 
(optional).</p>
